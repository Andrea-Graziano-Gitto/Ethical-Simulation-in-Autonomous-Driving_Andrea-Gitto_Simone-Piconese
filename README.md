Abstract:
This study endeavors to develop an ethical simulator for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system
deployed in autonomous vehicles. The primary aim is to investigate the behavior of the AI in
relation to the renowned ethical dilemma known as the "trolley problem." The simulation has
been meticulously designed to analyze the decision-making processes of the AI based on three
pivotal variables: ethical value, the age of the individuals involved, and the AIâ€™s preference
between younger and older individuals.
