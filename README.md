## Abstract:
This study endeavors to develop an ethical simulator for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system deployed in autonomous vehicles. The primary aim is to investigate the behavior of the AI in relation to the renowned ethical dilemma known as the "trolley problem." The simulation is designed to analyze the decision-making processes of the AI based on three pivotal variables: ethical value, the age of the individuals involved, and the AIâ€™s preference between younger and older individuals.
